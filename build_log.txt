Running Gradle task 'assembleRelease'...                        
Warning: Flutter support for your project's Kotlin version (1.9.24) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Kotlin version to a version of at least 2.1.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\Users\me\Desktop\Projects\test001\calc\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version, in which case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\Users\me\Desktop\Projects\test001\calc\android/build.gradle) by the ext.kotlin_version property.

Warning: The plugin flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle requires Android SDK version 36 or higher.
For more information about build configuration, see https://flutter.dev/to/review-gradle-config.
Warning: The plugin image_picker_android requires Android SDK version 36 or higher.
For more information about build configuration, see https://flutter.dev/to/review-gradle-config.
Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 35, but the following plugin(s) require to be compiled against a higher Android SDK version:
- flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle compiles against Android SDK 36
- image_picker_android compiles against Android SDK 36
Fix this issue by compiling against the highest Android SDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to C:\Users\me\Desktop\Projects\test001\calc\android\app\build.gradle.kts:

    android {
        compileSdk = 36
        ...
    }
Font asset "MaterialIcons-Regular.otf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 1645184 to 8276 bytes (99.5% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
